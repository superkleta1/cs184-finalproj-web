      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      Our project is a non-photorealistic watercolor rendering shader for
      Minecraft, inspired by the real-time watercolor techniques proposed by
      Luft and Deussen. Built using the Iris shader framework, our pipeline
      integrates multiple layered effects to simulate the soft, fluid
      characteristics of watercolor. We began by segmenting scene geometry using
      Minecraft’s internal mc_Entity attribute, enabling object-aware
      simplification. We then applied directional Gaussian blurs to remove hard
      textures and approximate the simplified washes of color typical in
      watercolor paintings. Intensity maps were derived from edge-aware blurs to
      drive pigment flow and edge diffusion. To mimic traditional techniques, we
      implemented edge darkening via alpha modulation and pigment granulation by
      perturbing paper texture values, creating the illusion of pigment settling
      into paper fibers. Due to Minecraft’s limitations on alpha transparency,
      we creatively redefined the alpha channel as a blending weight between
      scene color and paper texture. Additionally, we developed an ASCII shader
      variant using luminance-based glyph sampling and color quantization to
      simulate retro terminal-style visuals. Our results demonstrate a cohesive
      fusion of real-time graphics techniques and painterly stylization within a
      voxel-based rendering context.

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <h3>Watercolor shader</h3>
      <b>Simplification and abstraction</b>
      <br />
      To mimic the stylization of watercolor paintings, the first step of this
      method is to reduce visual complexity through simplification and
      abstraction.
      <br />
      First, we need to segment objects so that the properties of various
      objects such as color and edges can be processed separately. First, we
      imported the inherent attribute <code>mc_Entity</code> in Minecraft in
      <code>gbuffer_terrain.vsh</code> (different objects have unique IDs), and
      exported it to <code>gbuffer_terrain.fsh</code> as passedEntity, and
      normalized it to colortex4 to achieve the segmentation effect. <br />
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px">
        <img
          src="images/simplification_1.png"
          alt="Edge Darkening Illustration"
          style="max-width: 200px; width: 100%; height: auto"
        />
        <img
          src="images/simpli_2.png"
          alt="Edge Darkening Illustration"
          style="max-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto"
        />
      </div>

      After segmentation, we then get the base color of the object in
      <code>composite.fsh</code>, output it into colortex0. Next we applied a
      Gaussian convolution kernel to remove sharp textures and details, leaving
      only the basic color areas that define the scene, in order to imitate the
      blur of watercolor; it is worth mentioning that we did not use two layers
      of nested loops, instead, we blurred the X and Y directions separately,
      and output them to colortex5 and colortex6 respectively. They are mainly
      achieved in composite1.* and composite2.*.

      <br />
      <img
        src="images/simpli_3.png"
        alt="Edge Darkening Illustration"
        style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 400px"
        center
      />
      At the same time, after Gaussian blurring, we can use the edge strength to
      get the intensity variable, which specifically reflects the distance from
      a point to the edge, which is convenient for us to mix colors and further
      process them later. This is very different from the order in the paper
      where intensity is obtained first and then Gaussian blur is performed.
      This is because it is too troublesome to calculate the center of each
      continuous surface in Minecraft, and we have achieved an efficient
      replacement in this way.

      <br />
      Such simplified abstraction is similar to the wash-like blocks of color in
      traditional watercolor paintings. This abstraction reflects how human
      artists reduce the sense of reality in pursuit of clarity of expression.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b>Shape Exaction and Flow Pattern</b>
      <br />
      After obtaining the intensity and edge intensity, we can process the edges
      and feather the image (flow mode). We first processed colortex5 and
      colortex6, that is, the edge intensity in the horizontal and vertical
      directions, defined ktheta, and used this coefficient to perform weighted
      fusion of colortex5 and colortex6 in composite3.* and output it to
      colortex7. The specific formula is as follows:

      <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

        </mrow>
      </math>

      <br />
      We first defined kp, ks. Unlike the fusion of transparency in the paper,
      due to the characteristics of Minecraft, only special objects such as
      fluids and glass can modify the transparency, and other objects will be
      reset to 1 by the system even if the transparency is explicitly modified.
      Therefore, we directly use the derivative alpha of intensity as the
      weighting coefficient to directly fuse the object texture color and the
      paper texture color. In this way, we can smoothly blur and expand the
      boundary to achieve the effect of water diffusion. The specific formula is
      as follows:

      <b> Edge Darkening</b>
      <br />

      Edge darkening mimics the effect of traditional watercolor painting, where
      pigment gathers along the borders of the painted area. This is essential
      for emphasizing structural lines and shapes. The technique involves
      applying a dark semi-transparent layer along the detected edges to
      simulate the capillary effect, where wet pigment gathers at the edge of
      the wet area and becomes darker when it dries. By carefully controlling
      the density and transparency of these overlays, the system enhances edge
      contrast while retaining the soft beauty of water-based media. To achieve
      this, we define kw to further weight alpha to ensure that the color of the
      edges is darker. The specific formula is as follows, which is also
      implemented in final.fsh:

      />

      <b> Pigment Granulation</b>
      <br />
      The pigment particles simulate the uneven deposition and distribution of
      watercolor paint in the paper texture. In real watercolor paintings,
      heavier pigment particles tend to settle in the depressions on the paper
      surface, creating a mottled granular feel. To achieve this, in final.fsh,
      we first obtain the color of the paper texture, paperRGB, and assign it to
      t. Next, we transform the value range of t and map it to [-1,1] to
      simulate the depression of the paper. Next, we define kt to weight alpha
      and participate in the final color mixing. The specific formula is as
      follows.

      <b>Composition</b><br />
      In composition, we have designed a variety of modes for players to choose
      from. Here we only explain the most classic color mixing mode. In the
      above steps, we simulated the transparency alpha, and processed the
      original image step by step using operations such as Gaussian blur and
      edge enhancement to obtain C_rgb in the paper. Then, we extracted the
      texture of the paper as the background B_rgb. After that, we can use the
      following formula for weighting as the final output:

        center

      <b>Additional Function</b><br />
      We have designed many adjustable parameters for players to adjust the
      visual effects. For example, when the parameter PaperColor is checked as
      available, players can adjust the final saturation and hue through the
      built-in function adjustHueSaturation, as well as PAPER_SATURATION and
      PAPER_HUE in the UI. This series of functions are implemented in
      function.glsl, and we use the mutual conversion between RGB and HSV to
      achieve this. In addition, the coefficients mentioned above, such as kp,
      ks, etc., can all be adjusted to achieve satisfactory results.

      <br />
      <b>Problems encountered & workarounds</b><br />
      The problems we encountered mainly occurred due to restrictions on the
      Minecraft rendering pipeline. The first problem is how to tackle
      Minecraft's divisive rendering of nearby blocks. What Minecraft does is it
      demarcates the blocks no matter if they are the same type or not.
      <br />
      But to simulate a watercolor effect, we would like blocks of the same type
      to be considered one single object, therefore sharing color, without any
      boundaries within the intersection. What we did is we used Iris’ (a
      Minecraft shader tool) intrinsic MC_Entity variable, processed during
      gbuffer_* vertex shader passes. We manually assign a unique ID to a block
      type, and pass this value (flattening them out to ensure no interpolation)
      to the fragment shader so it knows which block the fragment belongs to. We
      then store all this information in a colortex file, with block ID as the
      value for each pixel.
      <br />
      Another problem occurs in the second stage: simplification and
      abstraction. The paper specifies using a gaussian blur function to
      calculate and output the intensity map for each object. We first tried
      implementing it with a 2D gaussian blur function with a double for-loop,
      but it is too costly given that we want a higher blur radius. We then
      decided to utilize the inherent shader pipeline to implement two 1D
      gaussian blur passes. We first horizontally blur for each pixel to get the
      intensity value from all horizontal neighbors and store these in a
      colortex. Then, in another composite pass, we vertically blur the values
      from this colortex to get a final intensity image as desired. This ensures
      that we optimize the runtime for real-time rendering while maintaining the
      same result.
      <br />
      Lastly, and again, a problem with Minecraft's incompatibility. Minecraft
      strictly prohibits any modification to its fragments' alpha values
      (opacity) beside some very special block entities (such as liquid or
      glass). With opacity being the main differentiator of a watercolor shader
      from others, we need to find a way to work around this. We came across
      this by using the alpha value to blend (interpolate) between the base
      color and the paper color instead. A higher opacity (therefore higher
      alpha value) would correspond to a lower amount of mix with the
      background, and vice versa. Through this, we were able to achieve a
      similar result.
      <br />
      <b>Lessons learned</b><br />
      Definitely keep optimization in mind when working on real time rendering.
      Any unoptimized or incautious algorithm could reflect in exponential
      rendering time and thus lower FPS and lag for the user. We had to redo our
      gaussian blur function because we didn’t keep that in mind. Also, another
      important takeaway is to carefully check documentation and learn the
      platform before starting. We only discovered Minecraft’s prohibition of
      alpha channel changes when we are already half way through the pipeline.
      Have we discovered earlier, we may come up with a work around to achieve a
      better result.

      <br />

      <h3>ASCII shader</h3>
      We create another Minecraft shader using the texture of a list of ASCII
      characters, with uniform colors on each glyph, to accomplish a retro
      “terminal” style shader. To achieve this, we downsampled the pixels into
      cells to represent ASCII characters, each using a downsampled color to
      represent the cell.
      <br />
      <b>Pipeline - Downsampling cells</b><br />
      First we segment the entire screen pixels to assign each cell to a list of
      ASCII characters. To determine which character to assign to, we sample
      within each cell to get a representing rgb color, and take the dot product
      with an illuminance vector that can be fine tuned. We choose the list of
      characters ‘@%#*+=-:.‘, where ‘@’ represents cells within the highest
      illuminance range and ‘.’ represents cells within the lowest illuminance
      range. We used the PIL library from python to generate the glyph texture.
      Then the texture of the character with the corresponding glyph coverage is
      mapped to all pixels within that cell.
      <br />
      <b>Pipeline - Downsampling colors</b><br />
      In order to create the effect of “terminal-style” art, we decided to
      downsample the colors as well to simulate the incapability for an old
      computer terminal to generate rich color. In addition to sampling the
      representing color for each cell, we also reduce the bit depth of the
      color for each pixel, so that limited numbers of color can be represented,
      and all colors would be converted to the nearest representable color.
      Lastly, the glyph texture is multiplied with the downsampled color to
      obtain the final result.
      <br /><br />

      <b>Problems encountered & workarounds</b><br />
      The first problem we encountered when downsampling cells is that most
      color ends up being within the lowest illuminance range, so that the
      screen is filled with mostly ‘.’. This not only creates the difficulty of
      distinguishing the texture and lighting of an object (as it is filled with
      only periods), but also makes the entire scene much dimmer than desired.
      We decided to add a sqrt function after the dot product to elevate the
      illuminance of pixels within the lower range. Below is a comparison of the
      effects before and after taking the sqrt.

      <img
        src="images/prob1_bef.png"
        style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 500px"
        center
      />
      <img
        src="images/prob1_after.png"
        style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 500px"
        center
      />

      Another issue occurs when downsampling the color. It turns out that
      reducing the bit depth on RGB values would distort the color (imagine r
      value is truncated to lower bit representation and g value is rounded to a
      higher one). To solve this problem, we implemented a function to convert
      the RGB value to HSV value, so that we can downsample the hue value
      separately. Below is a comparison of the original image, the images
      obtained through downsampling using RGB, and using HSV. In the RGB
      downsampling, it is clear that some pixels in the dirt and wood turn
      reddish, and the entire color tone turns cooler.
